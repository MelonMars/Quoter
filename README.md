This is a program that uses AI to create fake quotes on fake backdrops, credited to random people selected from a txt.
You need all the imports, to run use the website you need to use the command "uvicorn api:app --reload" in the terminal.
The website is a simple one, with a button that generates a new quote and a background image.
The website should be ran on localhost, and only used for localhost.
You need to be running stable diffusion webui from AUTOMATIC1111 for it to work, with the api plugin.

Also, I would just like to point out that for some reason I get a lot of stuff about animals.
